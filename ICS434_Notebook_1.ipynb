        "- Some of the questions below require that you only use methods or properties of a `DataFrame` or a `Series`. Therefore, any solution that uses a function that is not a method or property of `DataFrame` or `Series` will not be accepted, even when the solution yields an appropriate answer to the question.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For instance, if you are asked to find the number of entries in the DataFrame `tax_data` using only the DataFrame's methods or properties, then `len(tax_data)` is not an acceptable solution since `len()` is not a `tax_data` method. The statements below are both correct answers:\n",
        "\n",
        "> - `info()` is a method of `tax_data`.\n",
        "  \n",

        "\n",
        "- Similarly, if you are asked to count the number of unique entries in the `STATEFIPS` column of the `tax_data` DataFrame, then solutions using `set()` or `len()` are not acceptable for the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "> - The solution below uses `set()` and `len()`, which are not `tax_data` methods.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "> - The solution below uses `unique()`, which is a  `tax_data` method, but then counts the number of unique entries using `len()` which is not `tax_data` method.\n",
        "\n",

As such, I suggest you use `.SHIFT+TAB` or `.TAB` on objects liberally to see which methods and properties are available on objects. If you are unsure what a method does, use `SHIFT+TAB` to invoke the `docstring`, or documentation for that function. This is not only a good way to see which functionality can be used to answer the questions below but also a great way to familiarize yourself with the plethora of functionality available through the `pandas` package.\n",
